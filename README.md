# The Director
The Director is a special research project of the Riff.CC project, intended to completely decentralise the primary mechanisms that allow Riff.CC-based streaming services to operate.

## Usage
The software is designed to be used with Unit3D. Copy .rcc-tools.yml.EXAMPLE to your home directory, and fill it out with a Unit3D API key for an IPFS-only Unit3D site.

Then run `python3 director2.py`.

## Purpose
The Director creates a JSON-based "pseudo-API" suitable for consumption by applications, both SPA and traditional.

It is intended to create a package of metadata which can be stored entirely on IPFS and loaded as needed.

## Methodology

## Credits
The Director would not have been possible without the following:
