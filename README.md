# The Director
The Director is a special research project of the Riff.CC project, intended to completely decentralise the primary mechanisms that allow Riff.CC-based streaming services to operate.

See `DOCUMENTATION.md` for instructions on usage.

## Purpose
The Director creates a JSON-based "pseudo-API" suitable for consumption by applications, both SPA and traditional.

It is intended to create a package of metadata which can be stored entirely on IPFS and loaded as needed.

## Credits
The Director would not have been possible without the following:
